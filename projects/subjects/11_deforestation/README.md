# Amazon Deforestation Time Series Analysis

In this project, you'll explore how the Earth's surface is changing over time by analyzing multi-temporal data, analyzing the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **analyze the progression of deforestation in the Amazon basin** using satellite imagery. You’ll extract and visualize trends over time using real-world remote sensing data.

By the end of this project, you’ll:
- Load time series satellite imagery of the Amazon region.
- Apply vegetation indices like NDVI to detect changes.
- Quantify and visualize deforestation trends over time.
- (Optional) Predict future deforestation using a basic model.

## Dataset

You can use either the provided dataset from **Sentinel-2** or download another dataset targeting the area across different years.
