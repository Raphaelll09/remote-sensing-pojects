# Pansharpening

This project aims to develop and evaluate methodologies for fusing panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images acquired from the SPOT (Satellite Pour lâ€™Observation de la Terre) platform. The objective is to enhance the spatial resolution of multispectral images while preserving their spectral integrity by integrating the high-resolution details from the panchromatic image.

The study will involve implementing and comparing multiple image fusion techniques, such as:
- Component substitution
- Multi-resolution analysis
- Model-based approaches (Bayesian, etc.)
- Deep learning techniques


Evaluation will be conducted using both qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess spatial detail enhancement, spectral preservation, and overall fusion quality. Metrics such as SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper), ERGAS, Q-index, and PSNR can be used.

The final goal is to identify the strengths and limitations of each method in the context of SPOT imagery and provide practical insights for remote sensing applications such as land cover classification, urban monitoring, and environmental analysis.
