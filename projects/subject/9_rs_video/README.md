# Remote sensing video analysis
This project wants to explore processing video streams acquired by
remote sensing satellites. This acquisition modality is still under
development and can have a great potential in precision mapping and
tracking objects in a scene.

The data used in this project are prototype video sequences from
OPAZ acquired by Airbus during a flight test campaign over Barcelona, Catalonia in April 2016 @18cm resolution.
OPAZ (Optical Advanced EO System for Zephyr) is a dedicated Earth Observation system for Zephyr, Airbus High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS).
OPAZ is currently a prototype being developed by Airbus. It will provide
persistent surveillance over regional areas at 20cm resolution optical
imagery and video.

Example of a remote sensing video acquired over a beach in Barcelona.

## Hints

Possible applications that could be addressed by processing video frames:

- identification and tracking of moving objects
- superresolution: try to augment the spatial resolution of the scene by
  taking advantage on the presence of multiple acquisitions
- 3D model estimation by exploiting paraxial effects

Keywords:

- object tracking
- optical flow
- image registration
- background subtraction
